                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Peter, and I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University Idaho studying web design
                    with
                    a minor
                    in Chinese. I chose this path in my schooling because I found it to be the most fun and also the
                    most
                    rewarding of a challenge without being too much outside my comfort zone. Some hobbies of mine
                    include
                    playing the violin and composing music, as well as playing and watching basketball.</p>

                <h2>My Work Experience</h2>
                <p> Currently no work expereince except for some volunteer work I did at a warehouse and a food pantry.
                    During that time I learned how to
                    use a forklift in addition to some quality control type work. During that time I also learned better
                    public speaking and leadership skills.</p>
