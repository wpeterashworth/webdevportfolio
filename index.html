                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Peter, and I'm currently a student at Brigham Young University Idaho studying web design
                    with
                    a minor
                    in Chinese. I chose this path in my schooling because I found it to be the most fun and also the
                    most
                    rewarding of a challenge without being too much outside my comfort zone. Some hobbies of mine
                    include
                    playing the violin and composing music, as well as playing and watching basketball. I've also been
                    playing video games since I was kid, and still love them even though I've been leaning away from
                    playing them lately.</p>
